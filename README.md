# Core Lib
Based on [Example Mod](https://github.com/minecraft-cursed-legacy/Example-Mod)

This is a library for block models (and later Items and Particles, only partial support now) for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3, for Fabric.

## Notification
Save files made with version 1.2.0 and later are only partly compatible with no-modded game. Removing lib will not be safe for saves made with it, make backups.

## Setup
Dev: "gradlew eclipse" or "gradlew rebuildLVT genSources eclipse"
Build: "gradlew build"
